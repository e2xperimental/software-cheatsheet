# How to export a file to save space?

**Best Export Settings for Small File Size (H.264/MP4)&#xA0;**

1. **Open Export Mode:** Press **Ctrl+M** (Windows) or **Cmd+M** (macOS) to open the export settings.

2. **Format:** Select **H.264** (this will create an .mp4 file).

3. **Preset:** Choose **Match Source - Medium Bitrate** or **Match Source - Adaptive Low Bitrate** for a quick setup, or start with **Custom**.

4. **Video Tab - Basic Video Settings:**

   * Ensure **Frame Size** and **Frame Rate** match your source file (e.g., 1920x1080).
   * Check **"Render at Maximum Depth"**.

5. **Video Tab - Bitrate Settings (Crucial):**

   * **Bitrate Encoding:** Choose **VBR, 1 pass**.
   * **Target Bitrate \[Mbps]:** Set this between **5 and 10 Mbps** for a good balance of low size and acceptable quality. If you need it even smaller, you can go lower, but quality will decrease.
   * **Maximum Bitrate \[Mbps]:** Set slightly higher than the target (e.g., 10-12).

6. **Performance:** Select **Hardware Encoding** if available for faster exporting.

7. **Check Size:** Review the **Estimated File Size** at the bottom of the export window before clicking export.

**Alternative Method: H.265 (HEVC)**

For better quality at a lower file size than H.264, select **HEVC (H.265)** as the format. This requires more processing power but is more efficient at compressing videos while retaining quality.

**Key Tips for Low-Storage**

* **Check Original Bitrate:** To get the exact same file size ratio, check the bitrate of your original 344 MB video (right-click the file > Properties > Details) and match that number in the Premiere Pro Bitrate Settings.

* **Lower Resolution:** If the file is still too big, reducing the resolution (e.g., from 4K to 1080p or 1080p to 720p) will significantly reduce the size.

* **VBR vs. CBR:** Use **Variable Bitrate (VBR)** rather than Constant Bitrate (CBR) because it saves space by lowering the bitrate during simpler, less detailed parts of the video.
